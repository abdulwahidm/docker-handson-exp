## Introduction

Working on applications that run seamlessly across different machines can be a challenging aspect of software development. Docker, an open-source containerization platform, provides a solution by simplifying the deployment and management of applications. It achieves this by packaging applications into images that run in containers, allowing standardized execution across various environments.

This README.md file documents hands-on practices undertaken to master Docker, following the learning objectives outlined in the course:

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Define Docker and Explain Common Use Cases

Docker is introduced as an open-source containerization platform that facilitates the deployment and management of applications. Common use cases include ensuring consistent application performance across different environments and simplifying the development-to-production workflow.

### 2. Understand Container Functionalities vs. Virtual Machines

Explore the functional and operational differences between containers and virtual machines. Containers provide a lightweight and efficient solution for running applications with isolated dependencies, making them more portable across different environments.

### 3. Explore Key Docker Technologies

- **Layered Containers:** Understand the concept of layered containers and how Docker optimizes storage and resource usage through layering.
- **Dockerfile:** Learn about Dockerfiles, which serve as blueprints for creating custom container images, combining application source code with OS libraries and dependencies.
- **Docker API:** Explore Docker's API capabilities for managing and interacting with containers.

### 4. Create and Manage Containers using Docker CLI

Learn how to use the Docker CLI to create, start, stop, and remove containers. Gain proficiency in managing container lifecycle.

### 5. Create Custom Container Images with Dockerfiles

Understand the process of creating custom container images using Dockerfiles. Customize and optimize images to suit application requirements.

### 6. Push Docker Images to the Docker Registry and Manage Them

Explore the Docker registry and learn how to push custom images to it. Understand the significance of image management for versioning and distribution.

### 7. Troubleshoot Common Container Issues

Acquire skills in troubleshooting common container issues using Docker CLI commands. Learn how to identify and resolve problems to ensure smooth application deployment.

### 8. Understand Best Practices and Common Problems

Explore best practices when working with Docker containers and images. Identify and address common problems that may arise during the development and deployment process.

## Conclusion

This hands-on practice aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Docker, empowering developers to create, manage, and deploy applications in a consistent and efficient manner across various environments.
